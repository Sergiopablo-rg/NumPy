# Python for Data Analysis: Numpy
This is a summary of (notes and examples) Chapter 4: NumPy Basics from Python for Data Analisys book

Numpy has a fast array-processing capabilitie, one of its primary uses in data analysis is as a container for data to be passed between algorithms and libraries. Thus, many numerical computing tools for Python either assume NumPy arrays as a primary data structure or else target seamless interoperability with NumPy
